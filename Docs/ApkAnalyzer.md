# APK Analyzer

Android Studio includes an APK Analyzer that provides immediate insight into the composition of your APK or Android App Bundle after the build process completes. 

Using the apk analyzer we can achieve following things
- View the pakage name and version
- View the library size
- View the apk size (i.e, raw file size, download size)
- View the resource sizes and also unoptimized file sizes
- View the preview of xmls in human readable form
- Can see the manifest and also can verify what values are used in release app
- can also view full resource configurations (can view strings table values in different languages)
- the classes dex file also shows how close are we to 64k file limit

- Quickly view the final versions of files in the app, such as the AndroidManifest.xml file.
